# PlasmoTron
 PlasmoTron is an open-source robotic system built on top of the [OpenTrons](https://opentrons.com/) platform, to allow semi-automated culture of malaria parasites.

This version of the repo will be used for development of an OT2 compatible version of the original PlasmoTron. It is currently broken and should not be installed, feel free to try the original PlasmoTron at http://plasmotron.org


The OpenTrons API v2 docs are at https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/apiv2index.html
